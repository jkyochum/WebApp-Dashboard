# WebApp-Dashboard
Dynamic Dashboard Web Page / treehouse project 7

Many websites do more than just give you information. Sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint and Treehouse let users do things. They act like programs you run on your computer. These web applications, often include pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These "dashboards" act like your control panel for controlling the web app.

This project demonstrates these features. Certain elements on the page will react similar to a production style dashboard website.
